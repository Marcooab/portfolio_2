                <p class="paragraphs">  I was born in Florianópolis - Brazil in 1987, the city where I lived my first three decades of life, where I call home and where my beloved family (mother, father, older brother, sister-in-law, nephew, dogs) still resides. I had a childhood and adolescence surrounded by friends, beaches, football, music, etc...
                My student journey before college went smoothly. Around the age of 18 I started my first college, Computer Science, from which I attended 4 semesters before retiring (big regret).</p>
                <p class="paragraphs">  After some time in the job market, performing various types of functions in different areas, I started my second college, this time Law. After finishing the course, I was approved by the Brazilian Bar Association. I worked as a lawyer in Brazil for a few years, before moving to Portugal in early 2019, already looking at a new area of ​​practice, given my dissatisfaction with the legal area.</p>
                <p class="paragraphs">  In Portugal, after some adaptation time, I started my studies to become a Programmer. After a brief analysis of the current behavior of the job market, I decided, at first, to opt for Web Development.
                On my own, I started my studies with the triad HTML, CSS, Javascript. In the meantime, I also started my Systems Analysis and Development course at UNINTER college. I am currently taking courses equivalent to the second semester. Forecast for graduation in 06/2025.
                In the course I have the opportunity to have access to another language since Python is used as a basis for studies. In addition to the Systems Analysis and Development course, I continue my autonomous studies in the Web area (React, DOM, SCRUM, SAAS, EcmaScript...).</p>
                <p class="paragraphs">  Aware that the field of Information Technology, even more than in other areas, requires constant professional updating, I created a Portfolio where I can demonstrate some of my skills and implement the knowledge acquired over time, as well as, what comes being acquired and what is yet to come.
                Certain that learning is a “variable” in “constant” evolution, I feel minimally prepared and I make myself available.</p>
